<h2 id="who">Who</h2>
<p>We are the Chalmers students John Luc and Johnny Hamnesj√∂ taking a course in Mobile Computing.</p>
<h2 id="where">Where</h2>
<p>This is a prototype developed for the course CIU176 - Mobile Computing, design and implementation that&rsquo;s given at the department of Computer Science and Engineering at Chalmers University of Technology and the University of Gothenburg.</p>
<h2 id="what">What</h2>
<p>The theme for this project is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Authentication and Access<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, which means we are to design an innovative solution for the purpose of unlocking.</p>
<h2 id="vision">Vision</h2>
<p>Our vision was to create VALUE for the user - this means that we intended to design a tool that first and foremost was FUN to use, and secondly it should provide a sense of USEFULNESS.</p>
<h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>
<p>What we did was to prototype quick and dirty.</p>
<h3 id="first-week">First week</h3>
<p>We started out ideating and trying to empathize with the user. What did we actually want to accomplish?</p>
<p>We intially tried to keep the scope tight, so we wouldn&rsquo;t suffer from a feature creep. To this extent, we kept on with creating quick sketches and prototypes.</p>
<p><img src="/gestures_slide.png" alt="Gesture sketches"></p>
<p>This above image showcases one of the initial prototyping sequences where we storyboarded a user story.</p>
<p>As we initially ideated the actions of the user we hadn&rsquo;t asked us the question of WHY. We&rsquo;ll come back to that later on in the process, but for the context it&rsquo;s important to keep this in mind.</p>
<h4 id="knowing-when-to-quit">Knowing when to quit</h4>
<p>For the first week, we ideated several design concepts. We had been assigned challenges to solve, such as DESIGNING FOR THE REAL WORLD / RESEARCH THROUGH DESIGN / ARTISTIC SOMETHING.
For each of these, we ideated a concept based on this type of design research phase.</p>
<p><img src="/gesture_wireframe_thing.png" alt="Gesture sketches"></p>
<p>The prototype for one of our initial concepts got a higher fidelity prototype, where we tried to showcase both how the screens would work in reality, as well as the user flow.</p>
